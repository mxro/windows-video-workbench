Implement @/split/split.bat 

this should use the ffmpeg binary in @/ffmpeg/ 

it should look for any audio or video file in the same folder the script is located in (or accept any file that is dropped onto the script)

then it should split it into sections no longer than 25 min.

also add a README.md in this folder to explain how to use and configure the script.
